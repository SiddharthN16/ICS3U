# TASK

Create a simple Python program (in ```main.py```) that does the following:

- Use `input()` to gather a number from the user
- Process that information in some way (math)
- Use `print()` to display the results (with an appropriate message)

Do this several times (at least 5), using different math operations each time.


In your program be sure to:
 
- Include a Header
- Include descriptive comments
- Descriptive variable names in camelCase or pot_hole_case
