# TASK

This exercise makes use of an `Input/Output Test`.

Perform the following steps, being sure only to use `print()` when asked.  Comments are added to `main.py` to remind you of what is needed.

- Use a `while` loop to use `input()` to fill `groceryList`.  Items are added only if not already in the list.  Loop should stop when `'!'` is entered.

- Sort and `print()` the list.

- `print()` 3rd item, `print()` 3rd LAST item.

- `print()` slice of 4th through 6th item.  `print()` same slice BACKWARDS.

- Remove the last item.

- Take `input()`, remove that item if it exists.

- `print()` the list.


You are then given `intList`.  For each item in the list:

- if odd, multiply by 2 *(hint: I showed you the `%` operator in the first lesson!)*
- print the list

## Testing

When you are satisfied and want to fully test your code:

- Click on the checkmark on the left.
- Click "Run Tests"
- Click "Results" for any tests that you failed.  It will show you "Actual Output" (what you showed) and "Expected Output" (what should be there).
