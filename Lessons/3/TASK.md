# TASK

This exercise makes use of an `Input/Output Test`

## Factorial

A *factorial* is the product of all positive integers less than and equal to the number given:

5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1
   = 120

8! = 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1
= 40 320

You will take the `number` variable (integer):

- If `number` is less than 1, print `Error.`
- Otherwise, use a `while` loop to calculate and then print the factorial.


## Adding

You will take the `begin` and `end` variables (integers):

- If `begin` is greater than `end`, print `"Error."`.
- Otherwise, calculate the total of all integers between `begin` and `end` (inclusive). Use a `for` loop to complete this.
- For example, if `3` and `8` are entered, you will calculate `3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8` and print the result.


## Testing

When you are satisfied and want to fully test your code:

- Click on the checkmark on the left.
- Click "Run Tests"
- Click "Results" for any tests that you failed.  It will show you "Actual Output" (what you showed) and "Expected Output" (what should be there).
