# TASK

This exercise makes use of an `Input/Output Test`.


You will check the `grade` variable (integer) and `print()` an appropriate message (string). The message **must** be written exactly as given:

- 80 or higher: **"Exceeding Expectations."**
- 70 to 79: **"Meeting Expectations."**
- 50 to 69: **"Needs Improvement."**
- Less than 50: **"Not Passing."**
- Any 'invalid' grade: **"Invalid Grade."**

Do **not** add a message to the `input()`, or add anything to the above messages.  Any additional output may throw off the `Input/Output Test`.

Test your program yourself before running the `Input/Output Test`.


## Testing

When you are satisfied and want to fully test your code:

- Click on the checkmark on the left.
- Click "Run Tests"
- Click "Results" for any tests that you failed.  It will show you "Actual Output" (what you showed) and "Expected Output" (what should be there).
