# TASK

This exercise makes use of an `Input/Output Test`.

Perform the following steps, being sure only to use `print()` when asked.  Comments are added to `main.py` to remind you of what is needed.


The dictionary `groceryDict` will have the names of the foods (strings) as the *keys* and the quantities needed (integers) as the *values*.

- Use a `while` loop to add key/value until `!` entered.  If key doesn't exist, add the key/value. If key exists, increment the value.
- `print()` dictionary.
- Take `input()`.  Remove from dictionary if key exists.
- Calculate the sum of all values. `print()` the sum.
## Testing

When you are satisfied and want to fully test your code:

- Click on the checkmark on the left.
- Click "Run Tests"
- Click "Results" for any tests that you failed.  It will show you "Actual Output" (what you showed) and "Expected Output" (what should be there).
