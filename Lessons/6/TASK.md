## Main Code

Copy both functions from the previous exercise.

Write some main code that makes **multiple calls** (that produce different results) of the `milesToKm()` function OR `salesCalc()` function.  Tell a story, do whatever you want - be creative!

*Don't worry if "Error." is returned - we'll deal with that on Monday.*
